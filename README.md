## Project Description
Concert Calendar will allow users to search for concerts in their zip code on a specific date. They will be able to select any they're interested in to add them to a list containing links to buy tickets to those concerts.

##Functionality
MVP:
*Styled UI that accepts User Input and saves it to state
*Calling and receiving concert data from Ticketmaster API conditionally based on user input
*Rendering concert data to user in clear way, while providing user means to both save concerts of their choice, and a link to buy tickets for those concerts

Post-MVP:
*Using walkthrough from blog.flowandform.agency and date-Fns library to create interactive calendar in React
*Remove date input from form, let user click date box on calendar to search concerts for that date
*Utilize modal windows for event list when calendar date is clicked
